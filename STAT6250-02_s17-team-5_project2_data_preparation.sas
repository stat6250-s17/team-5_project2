[Dataset 1 Name] ClassEnrollment14F12.csv

[Dataset Description] This dataset pertains to Class Enrollment records
for 2014 forstudents by gender and ethnicity and by type of course and 
specific class. A record is created for every class, gender and ethnicity 
in a school that has students enrolled on Information Day and includes 
unduplicated count of students in a class. From this dataset, which
was too large to upload to Github, this smaller file was created in 
Escel - pertaining to class enrollment by 12th grade female students.
Some column names were shortened and rows that included multiple courses
that would make reading data problematic were deleted.
